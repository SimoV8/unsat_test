Before k1 < 3, a0 > 5 eventually holds.
After e0 <= 1, it is always the case that if d0 = 7 holds, then b1 <= 4 eventually holds.
Between o0 > 3 and l0 <= 4, it is always the case that if v0 <= 6 holds, then r0 >= 0 previously held.
After l1 = 4, it is always the case that if o0 > 3 holds, then v0 > 5 eventually holds.
Before q0 = 6, it is always the case that if j0 <= 7 holds, then j0 < 1 previously held.
Between j1 > 4 and e0 < 2, it is never the case that x0 = 1 holds.
Before b1 >= 5, it is always the case that if i1 > 0 holds, then l0 < 3 eventually holds.
Before c0 > 0, it is always the case that f0 >= 7 holds.
Before m0 <= 4, it is always the case that if k0 > 2 holds, then v0 < 4 eventually holds.
After f1 <= 4 until b0 <= 5, it is always the case that if h0 > 4 holds, then v0 > 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by e0 = 6 .
After q0 = 7 until w0 < 0, it is always the case that if z0 >= 0 holds, then i0 <= 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by o0 >= 5, where v0 <= 7 does not hold between i0 <= 3 and o0 >= 5 .
After t0 < 3 until f1 > 6, it is always the case that if i1 < 7 holds and is succeeded by m0 < 7, then h0 = 3 previously held.
Before m0 = 0, it is always the case that if a0 >= 2 holds, then r0 >= 7 previously held and was preceded by f1 = 7 .
Before r0 > 7, it is always the case that if a0 = 3 holds, then j0 > 2 previously held.
Between x0 <= 2 and k1 > 3, c1 >= 6 eventually holds.
