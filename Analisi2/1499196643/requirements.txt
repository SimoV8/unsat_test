Between a0 >= 1 and b0 <= 5, it is always the case that if b0 < 0 holds, then d0 < 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 < 2, where a0 > 1 does not hold between d0 < 1 and a0 < 2 .
Before a0 = 1, it is always the case that b0 <= 7 holds.
After c0 > 3, it is always the case that if a0 > 0 holds, then d0 < 3 previously held.
Before d0 > 1, it is always the case that b0 > 3 holds.
Before d0 <= 4, it is always the case that if a0 >= 2 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 1, then d0 <= 6 previously held.

Before b0 >= 3, it is always the case that if d0 <= 5 holds, then d0 >= 4 previously held and was preceded by c0 >= 7 .
After b0 <= 2 until c0 >= 2, it is always the case that if d0 < 5 holds and is succeeded by b0 > 7, then b0 < 2 eventually holds after b0 > 7 .
After c0 = 5 until d0 >= 0, it is always the case that if b0 > 1 holds, then c0 >= 0 eventually holds.
Between c0 = 4 and b0 < 1, it is always the case that a0 < 6 holds.
