Before d0 = 1, it is always the case that if b1 > 2 holds and is succeeded by d1 < 5, then m0 < 3 eventually holds after d1 < 5 .
After c1 > 2, it is always the case that if b1 <= 0 holds, then w0 >= 6 eventually holds and is succeeded by b1 > 4, where g1 >= 1 does not hold between w0 >= 6 and b1 > 4 .
After i0 = 1 until s0 = 1, it is never the case that t0 > 4 holds.
Between m0 < 0 and b0 = 2, it is always the case that b0 = 7 holds.
After f0 <= 2, it is always the case that if i0 <= 0 holds, then a0 >= 0 previously held.
After a1 > 1 until e0 <= 2, it is always the case that if k1 <= 3 holds, then c1 >= 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by j0 < 4 .
Between r0 > 4 and z0 = 7, it is always the case that if n0 = 5 holds, then c0 = 3 eventually holds.
After g1 > 1, it is always the case that if m0 >= 6 holds, then b0 < 0 previously held.
Before e0 > 1, it is always the case that if m1 = 2 holds, then e0 = 6 previously held.
After o0 >= 0, it is never the case that i1 = 2 holds.
After v0 > 2, m1 = 3 eventually holds.
After i1 >= 7 until j0 = 4, it is always the case that if k1 <= 7 holds, then d1 = 7 eventually holds and is succeeded by i0 < 4, where l0 >= 5 does not hold between d1 = 7 and i0 < 4 .
Before e1 <= 0, it is never the case that a0 > 7 holds.
Between j1 <= 4 and a0 < 3, it is always the case that l1 < 1 holds.
After c1 <= 4, w0 < 5 eventually holds.
Between h0 = 1 and z0 < 7, it is never the case that y0 >= 6 holds.
Globally, h1 = 0 eventually holds.
