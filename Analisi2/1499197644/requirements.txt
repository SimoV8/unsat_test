Between e0 > 4 and f0 > 7, it is always the case that if a0 < 6 holds, then b0 < 6 eventually holds.
Between f0 < 6 and f0 >= 0, it is always the case that if b0 > 4 holds and is succeeded by f0 = 1, then i0 <= 1 eventually holds after f0 = 1 .
Before g0 >= 0, it is always the case that i0 < 1 holds.
After e0 = 3 until f0 < 3, it is always the case that if c0 < 3 holds and is succeeded by b0 <= 3, then f0 >= 2 eventually holds after b0 <= 3 .
Between e0 = 0 and c0 > 0, it is always the case that if h0 <= 1 holds, then i0 > 5 eventually holds.
After i0 <= 2 until h0 > 2, it is always the case that if c0 >= 5 holds, then e0 > 7 eventually holds and is succeeded by i0 >= 5, where e0 >= 7 does not hold between e0 > 7 and i0 >= 5 .
Before b0 < 4, it is always the case that if i0 < 1 holds, then a0 >= 4 previously held and was preceded by d0 = 6 .
Between f0 <= 2 and b0 > 1, it is always the case that if c0 > 5 holds and is succeeded by d0 >= 5, then i0 < 3 eventually holds after d0 >= 5 .
Before c0 <= 6, it is never the case that h0 >= 6 holds.
After c0 <= 4 until d0 = 0, it is always the case that if e0 < 1 holds, then a0 = 6 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 4, where h0 <= 6 does not hold between a0 = 6 and a0 = 4 .
Globally, it is never the case that f0 >= 2 holds.
After a0 = 4 until i0 = 0, it is always the case that if g0 < 7 holds, then i0 > 7 eventually holds and is succeeded by d0 < 2, where b0 > 6 does not hold between i0 > 7 and d0 < 2 .
Globally, it is always the case that if h0 < 1 holds, then g0 <= 0 previously held and was preceded by h0 = 2 .
After d0 >= 7 until e0 > 5, it is always the case that if i0 > 6 holds, then h0 = 6 previously held.
