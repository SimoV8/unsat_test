Between f0 < 0 and h0 = 3, it is always the case that if i0 >= 3 holds, then f0 = 2 previously held.
After h0 <= 2 until h0 >= 1, it is always the case that e0 < 0 holds.
After d0 >= 1 until h0 >= 1, f0 >= 0 eventually holds.
Between a0 > 0 and a0 > 3, it is always the case that if i0 < 2 holds, then f0 = 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by f0 < 1, where a0 >= 3 does not hold between f0 = 1 and f0 < 1 .
After c0 >= 2, it is never the case that f0 < 3 holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if i0 < 1 holds, then e0 < 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by e0 >= 3 .
After i0 < 3 until g0 > 3, it is always the case that if e0 <= 2 holds and is succeeded by g0 > 2, then b0 > 3 eventually holds after g0 > 2 .
Globally, it is always the case that h0 >= 3 holds.
After e0 <= 2 until b0 >= 1, it is always the case that if i0 <= 0 holds and is succeeded by b0 > 2, then e0 > 2 eventually holds after b0 > 2 .
