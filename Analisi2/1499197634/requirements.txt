Globally, i0 >= 2 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if b0 >= 6 holds, then g0 <= 1 previously held.
Globally, it is always the case that if d0 >= 1 holds, then b0 <= 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 5, where a0 > 1 does not hold between b0 <= 2 and a0 > 5 .
Before d0 = 1, it is always the case that if b0 > 1 holds, then i0 <= 6 previously held.
After b0 > 6 until i0 >= 0, it is always the case that if f0 < 6 holds, then h0 > 6 previously held.
Between i0 <= 5 and c0 = 1, it is always the case that if h0 <= 7 holds, then a0 > 0 previously held and was preceded by i0 <= 5 .
Globally, it is always the case that if e0 <= 3 holds, then c0 = 5 eventually holds and is succeeded by i0 <= 6 .
Before i0 >= 3, h0 <= 7 eventually holds.
After b0 >= 0 until e0 <= 6, e0 <= 0 eventually holds.
After i0 > 7, it is always the case that if c0 < 4 holds, then i0 > 6 eventually holds and is succeeded by h0 = 7 .
Globally, it is always the case that if f0 < 0 holds, then c0 > 6 previously held.
Globally, it is always the case that if h0 > 2 holds, then d0 > 5 previously held and was preceded by g0 = 3 .
After c0 < 2 until d0 < 3, f0 < 0 eventually holds.
After a0 > 2, it is always the case that if h0 >= 3 holds, then d0 > 3 previously held and was preceded by i0 < 3 .
After g0 < 2 until d0 > 0, it is always the case that if e0 = 0 holds and is succeeded by g0 > 6, then i0 = 3 eventually holds after g0 > 6 .
