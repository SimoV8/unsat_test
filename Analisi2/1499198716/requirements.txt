After g0 < 6, it is always the case that if k0 <= 4 holds, then r0 <= 2 previously held and was preceded by g0 < 6 .
After g0 <= 2, it is always the case that n0 >= 4 holds.
Between j0 = 7 and l0 = 6, it is always the case that if b0 < 5 holds and is succeeded by j0 >= 3, then g0 = 7 eventually holds after j0 >= 3 .
After p0 <= 4, it is always the case that if b0 = 1 holds, then e0 = 2 eventually holds.
After n0 <= 7, it is always the case that if s0 < 6 holds and is succeeded by q0 <= 2, then g0 <= 1 eventually holds after q0 <= 2 .
After r0 >= 7 until p0 = 6, it is always the case that if h0 <= 4 holds, then m0 >= 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by q0 <= 4 .
Globally, it is always the case that if n0 < 6 holds, then e0 > 6 eventually holds and is succeeded by r0 > 2, where c0 = 6 does not hold between e0 > 6 and r0 > 2 .
After r0 > 0, it is always the case that if c0 >= 7 holds and is succeeded by c0 = 1, then r0 <= 5 previously held.
Between q0 = 3 and o0 = 3, it is always the case that if m0 <= 5 holds, then i0 >= 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by d0 < 3, where a0 <= 4 does not hold between i0 >= 3 and d0 < 3 .
Globally, it is always the case that if c0 <= 5 holds, then d0 = 6 eventually holds.
After p0 <= 1, it is always the case that b0 > 2 holds.
Before a0 > 4, it is always the case that h0 >= 4 holds.
Between e0 = 3 and m0 <= 2, it is always the case that if o0 <= 3 holds, then m0 = 1 eventually holds.
After j0 < 5 until l0 > 6, it is always the case that if q0 <= 4 holds, then e0 > 1 eventually holds.
Before s0 <= 4, it is never the case that g0 <= 1 holds.
