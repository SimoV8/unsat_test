After i0 <= 6 until f0 >= 0, it is always the case that if a0 <= 7 holds, then e0 > 4 previously held and was preceded by g0 < 5 .
Between e0 >= 7 and i0 > 3, it is never the case that e0 < 3 holds.
Before b0 >= 7, it is always the case that if f0 > 4 holds, then i0 >= 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by d0 >= 2, where h0 <= 2 does not hold between i0 >= 3 and d0 >= 2 .
Globally, h0 > 0 eventually holds.
After c0 > 7 until c0 > 4, it is always the case that i0 <= 1 holds.
Before a0 >= 7, h0 > 1 eventually holds.
Between a0 >= 0 and h0 > 1, it is always the case that if e0 <= 6 holds and is succeeded by i0 > 4, then g0 <= 4 previously held.
After a0 > 5 until b0 >= 0, it is always the case that if a0 <= 1 holds, then b0 >= 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by e0 > 0, where f0 < 3 does not hold between b0 >= 2 and e0 > 0 .
Before a0 <= 5, d0 > 0 eventually holds.
Before c0 <= 4, it is always the case that if a0 < 5 holds, then e0 < 1 eventually holds.
