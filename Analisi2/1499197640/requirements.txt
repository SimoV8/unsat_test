Between h0 <= 7 and g0 > 7, it is always the case that if c0 > 5 holds, then a0 > 2 eventually holds.
After d0 < 1 until g0 > 3, it is always the case that if a0 < 1 holds, then g0 > 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by b0 = 0 .
Before h0 < 1, it is never the case that h0 < 1 holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if e0 > 1 holds and is succeeded by i0 >= 2, then d0 = 5 previously held.
Before h0 >= 2, it is always the case that d0 <= 2 holds.
After h0 > 7 until i0 >= 6, it is always the case that if d0 > 1 holds, then i0 = 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by c0 >= 3, where g0 > 2 does not hold between i0 = 1 and c0 >= 3 .
After a0 <= 5 until i0 = 6, it is always the case that if b0 <= 2 holds, then b0 <= 1 previously held.
After c0 > 0, f0 = 1 eventually holds.
Between g0 < 2 and i0 >= 6, it is never the case that g0 <= 5 holds.
After a0 <= 4, it is always the case that if i0 > 7 holds, then f0 >= 7 eventually holds and is succeeded by f0 < 7, where g0 > 1 does not hold between f0 >= 7 and f0 < 7 .
After c0 < 2 until c0 < 5, it is always the case that if b0 <= 6 holds, then g0 >= 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by d0 <= 3 .
After e0 = 7 until c0 < 4, it is always the case that if g0 <= 6 holds and is succeeded by e0 > 0, then i0 = 2 eventually holds after e0 > 0 .
