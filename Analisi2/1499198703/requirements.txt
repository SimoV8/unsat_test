Between h0 <= 1 and a0 > 5, it is always the case that if m0 > 0 holds, then l0 = 4 eventually holds and is succeeded by f0 <= 6 .
Between k0 <= 3 and h0 <= 7, it is always the case that if k0 = 4 holds, then j0 >= 7 previously held and was preceded by b0 >= 7 .
After l0 <= 6 until j0 <= 1, it is always the case that if k0 > 4 holds and is succeeded by d0 <= 7, then s0 < 2 previously held.
Between d0 = 4 and q0 >= 1, it is always the case that if q0 >= 6 holds and is succeeded by n0 > 4, then s0 >= 2 previously held.
Globally, it is always the case that if g0 > 0 holds, then b0 <= 0 eventually holds.
After i0 = 3 until r0 >= 5, it is always the case that if a0 <= 4 holds, then i0 <= 6 previously held.
Globally, it is never the case that o0 >= 5 holds.
Between l0 <= 6 and o0 <= 1, it is always the case that if c0 < 3 holds, then q0 <= 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by k0 = 2, where n0 <= 1 does not hold between q0 <= 3 and k0 = 2 .
Before g0 = 2, it is always the case that if h0 <= 2 holds and is succeeded by r0 = 4, then q0 > 1 previously held.
Before b0 < 3, it is always the case that if r0 = 7 holds and is succeeded by e0 <= 1, then r0 < 4 eventually holds after e0 <= 1 .
Between c0 = 5 and e0 < 2, it is always the case that if l0 >= 1 holds, then h0 = 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by l0 > 4, where n0 <= 3 does not hold between h0 = 0 and l0 > 4 .
