After c0 = 0 until s0 <= 5, it is always the case that if q0 >= 2 holds, then y0 = 7 previously held and was preceded by e1 > 6 .
Before l0 >= 5, s0 = 4 eventually holds.
After l0 > 5 until j1 > 6, it is always the case that if i0 = 3 holds and is succeeded by m0 > 4, then y0 < 4 previously held.
Globally, it is always the case that if j0 <= 2 holds and is succeeded by g0 >= 6, then b1 <= 5 previously held.
After s0 <= 1, it is always the case that if w0 > 2 holds, then e1 > 5 previously held.
After g1 > 3 until l0 >= 4, it is always the case that w0 >= 1 holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if n0 < 2 holds, then j0 > 6 previously held and was preceded by m0 = 1 .
Globally, it is always the case that if g0 > 7 holds, then w0 >= 4 eventually holds and is succeeded by f0 < 3, where m1 = 2 does not hold between w0 >= 4 and f0 < 3 .
Between n0 >= 4 and j1 < 0, it is always the case that if o0 > 5 holds, then w0 >= 2 eventually holds.
Between l1 < 3 and s0 > 0, it is never the case that l0 >= 1 holds.
After c1 > 2 until c0 < 1, it is never the case that a1 >= 2 holds.
After h0 <= 5 until e1 < 4, it is always the case that if w0 <= 4 holds, then k0 >= 1 eventually holds.
Globally, it is never the case that e1 > 4 holds.
