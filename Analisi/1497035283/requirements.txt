Globally, it is never the case that a0 = 0 holds.
After b0 <= 0, it is always the case that if a0 < 1 holds, then d0 > 0 previously held and was preceded by d0 > 1 .
After c0 < 0 until e0 > 1, it is always the case that if c0 <= 0 holds, then d0 = 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by c0 <= 1, where c0 >= 0 does not hold between d0 = 0 and c0 <= 1 .
After d0 > 1 until d0 > 0, it is always the case that if a0 = 1 holds, then f0 <= 1 eventually holds.
Before b0 >= 0, it is always the case that if c0 = 1 holds, then f0 = 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by f0 <= 0 .

Before a0 = 1, c0 >= 0 eventually holds.
Before b0 < 1, a0 = 1 eventually holds.
