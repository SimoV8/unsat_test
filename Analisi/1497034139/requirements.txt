Between a0 <= 1 and a0 > 1, it is always the case that if a0 <= 1 holds, then a0 > 0 previously held.
After a0 = 1, it is always the case that if a0 < 0 holds and is succeeded by a0 > 1, then a0 > 0 previously held.
Globally, it is always the case that a0 > 0 holds.
After a0 = 1, it is always the case that if a0 >= 0 holds, then a0 >= 1 previously held.
After a0 >= 0, it is always the case that if a0 >= 0 holds, then a0 = 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 1, where a0 > 1 does not hold between a0 = 0 and a0 = 1 .
Before a0 < 1, it is always the case that if a0 > 1 holds, then a0 > 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 1 .
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 <= 0 holds, then a0 < 0 previously held.
After a0 < 0, it is always the case that if a0 >= 1 holds, then a0 = 0 previously held and was preceded by a0 >= 0 .
