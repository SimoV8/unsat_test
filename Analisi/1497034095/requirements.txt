Between a0 <= 3 and a0 >= 0, it is always the case that if a0 = 3 holds, then a0 <= 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 0, where a0 > 0 does not hold between a0 <= 0 and a0 >= 0 .
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 > 3 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 3, then a0 <= 1 previously held.
After a0 < 2 until a0 > 2, it is never the case that a0 < 3 holds.
Between a0 > 3 and a0 < 2, it is always the case that if a0 >= 2 holds, then a0 < 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 2 .
