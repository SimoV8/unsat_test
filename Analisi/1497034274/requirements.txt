Before a0 < 4, it is always the case that if a0 <= 6 holds and is succeeded by a0 > 0, then a0 < 3 previously held.
After a0 > 3, it is never the case that a0 > 5 holds.
After a0 <= 6, it is always the case that if a0 <= 1 holds and is succeeded by a0 = 6, then a0 = 3 eventually holds after a0 = 6 .
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 <= 7 holds, then a0 < 0 previously held.
After a0 < 6 until a0 > 6, it is always the case that if a0 < 4 holds, then a0 >= 6 eventually holds.
Before a0 >= 3, it is always the case that if a0 <= 6 holds, then a0 < 1 previously held.
Between a0 > 4 and a0 > 7, it is always the case that a0 >= 2 holds.
Between a0 < 2 and a0 > 6, it is always the case that if a0 > 6 holds, then a0 < 2 eventually holds.
After a0 >= 7, it is always the case that if a0 < 3 holds, then a0 = 6 eventually holds.
After a0 > 2, it is always the case that a0 <= 1 holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 > 5 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 3, then a0 > 7 previously held.
Between a0 >= 1 and a0 > 7, it is always the case that if a0 <= 4 holds, then a0 <= 5 previously held and was preceded by a0 > 6 .
After a0 >= 0, it is always the case that if a0 <= 3 holds, then a0 > 5 eventually holds.
Between a0 = 4 and a0 <= 7, a0 <= 3 eventually holds.
After a0 < 6 until a0 <= 5, it is always the case that if a0 >= 6 holds, then a0 >= 5 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 < 7, where a0 < 5 does not hold between a0 >= 5 and a0 < 7 .
Globally, it is never the case that a0 >= 0 holds.
