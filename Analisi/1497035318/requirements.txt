Before e0 = 0, b0 > 3 eventually holds.
After g0 < 1 until d0 <= 2, it is always the case that if b0 = 2 holds, then e0 > 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by c0 >= 2 .
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 > 0 holds, then a0 >= 2 previously held and was preceded by e0 < 3 .
Between d0 <= 3 and a0 > 2, it is always the case that if e0 = 3 holds, then b0 > 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by c0 >= 0 .
Globally, c0 >= 3 eventually holds.
Between b0 <= 0 and f0 >= 1, it is always the case that if g0 < 3 holds and is succeeded by g0 > 2, then a0 = 3 previously held.
After b0 < 1, it is always the case that if g0 >= 1 holds, then g0 = 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by f0 < 2 .
Between c0 = 1 and e0 <= 1, it is always the case that if a0 < 1 holds, then a0 >= 2 previously held and was preceded by d0 < 0 .
Globally, it is always the case that if b0 > 0 holds, then b0 < 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by e0 = 1, where b0 <= 3 does not hold between b0 < 1 and e0 = 1 .
After a0 = 1, it is always the case that if f0 > 1 holds and is succeeded by g0 <= 0, then g0 <= 3 eventually holds after g0 <= 0 .
Before a0 >= 2, it is never the case that e0 <= 2 holds.
After g0 = 3, it is never the case that c0 >= 0 holds.
After e0 > 2 until d0 <= 2, it is always the case that if d0 < 2 holds, then g0 < 2 eventually holds.
After e0 = 3, it is always the case that if g0 < 3 holds, then g0 = 0 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if c0 <= 3 holds, then b0 <= 2 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if d0 <= 1 holds, then f0 < 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by g0 > 2, where g0 <= 3 does not hold between f0 < 0 and g0 > 2 .
