Before a0 <= 6, it is always the case that a0 <= 7 holds.
Before a0 = 6, it is always the case that if a0 = 7 holds, then a0 < 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 5, where a0 <= 6 does not hold between a0 < 3 and a0 > 5 .
Between a0 <= 1 and a0 < 2, a0 > 6 eventually holds.
Before a0 = 7, it is always the case that if a0 = 1 holds, then a0 > 5 previously held.
Between a0 = 1 and a0 > 0, it is always the case that if a0 <= 7 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 6, then a0 > 1 eventually holds after a0 <= 6 .
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 = 6 holds, then a0 < 0 eventually holds.
After a0 > 5, it is always the case that if a0 >= 3 holds, then a0 = 1 previously held.
After a0 = 2 until a0 > 1, it is always the case that if a0 >= 2 holds, then a0 >= 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 6 .
After a0 = 6 until a0 <= 1, it is never the case that a0 = 1 holds.
After a0 < 6, it is always the case that if a0 <= 6 holds, then a0 < 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 0, where a0 = 6 does not hold between a0 < 3 and a0 >= 0 .
Before a0 <= 0, it is always the case that if a0 > 2 holds, then a0 = 4 previously held.
After a0 <= 1 until a0 >= 7, it is always the case that if a0 < 2 holds, then a0 <= 1 previously held and was preceded by a0 >= 1 .
Before a0 > 0, it is always the case that if a0 < 4 holds, then a0 <= 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 4, where a0 < 0 does not hold between a0 <= 3 and a0 <= 4 .
Before a0 >= 3, it is always the case that if a0 > 3 holds, then a0 >= 1 eventually holds.
Between a0 > 2 and a0 <= 1, it is always the case that if a0 = 6 holds and is succeeded by a0 = 3, then a0 > 4 eventually holds after a0 = 3 .
Before a0 = 4, it is always the case that if a0 > 2 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 0, then a0 > 0 previously held.
