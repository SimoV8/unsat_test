After a0 > 2, it is always the case that if a0 <= 1 holds, then a0 <= 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 3 .
Before a0 = 3, it is always the case that if a0 >= 2 holds, then a0 = 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 3, where a0 <= 0 does not hold between a0 = 2 and a0 = 3 .
Before a0 = 1, a0 <= 1 eventually holds.
Between a0 > 3 and a0 = 3, it is never the case that a0 > 3 holds.
Before a0 = 1, a0 = 0 eventually holds.
Globally, it is never the case that a0 < 1 holds.
Between a0 <= 3 and a0 <= 0, it is always the case that if a0 <= 3 holds, then a0 <= 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 < 1, where a0 <= 1 does not hold between a0 <= 1 and a0 < 1 .
Between a0 > 2 and a0 <= 0, it is always the case that if a0 >= 2 holds, then a0 >= 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 2 .
