After c0 = 1, it is always the case that if a0 > 1 holds, then c0 = 0 previously held and was preceded by b0 > 0 .
Globally, it is always the case that c0 > 1 holds.
Before b0 >= 0, it is always the case that if b0 < 1 holds and is succeeded by c0 = 0, then b0 >= 1 eventually holds after c0 = 0 .
Globally, c0 <= 0 eventually holds.
After c0 > 1, it is always the case that if b0 = 0 holds, then a0 > 0 previously held and was preceded by a0 <= 0 .
Between c0 > 1 and a0 >= 0, it is always the case that if b0 >= 1 holds, then c0 < 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 1, where c0 = 0 does not hold between c0 < 1 and a0 <= 1 .
After c0 < 1 until a0 = 1, it is never the case that c0 >= 0 holds.
After c0 > 1 until b0 < 1, it is always the case that if a0 >= 0 holds, then c0 <= 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 0, where b0 < 0 does not hold between c0 <= 1 and a0 > 0 .
Between b0 > 0 and a0 = 0, a0 = 1 eventually holds.
