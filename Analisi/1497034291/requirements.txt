After a0 < 7, a0 < 2 eventually holds.
After a0 < 6, it is always the case that if a0 <= 5 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 3, then a0 <= 0 previously held.
After a0 = 0, it is always the case that a0 > 2 holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 <= 6 holds, then a0 >= 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 2, where a0 <= 0 does not hold between a0 >= 3 and a0 > 2 .
After a0 > 1 until a0 >= 3, it is always the case that if a0 >= 7 holds, then a0 < 7 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 = 2 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 1, then a0 >= 3 eventually holds after a0 <= 1 .
After a0 > 7 until a0 <= 1, it is always the case that if a0 > 2 holds, then a0 <= 1 eventually holds.
Between a0 > 1 and a0 = 4, it is always the case that if a0 <= 6 holds, then a0 >= 6 previously held and was preceded by a0 <= 5 .
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 <= 0 holds, then a0 >= 0 previously held and was preceded by a0 < 7 .
Before a0 = 6, it is always the case that if a0 >= 4 holds, then a0 < 0 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 < 6 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 4, then a0 = 0 previously held.
After a0 >= 5, it is always the case that if a0 = 3 holds and is succeeded by a0 > 6, then a0 > 3 previously held.
