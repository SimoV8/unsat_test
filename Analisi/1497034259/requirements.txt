After a0 = 1, it is always the case that if a0 < 3 holds, then a0 <= 1 eventually holds.
After a0 >= 1, it is always the case that if a0 <= 1 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 0, then a0 <= 3 previously held.
Between a0 = 0 and a0 >= 2, it is always the case that if a0 >= 2 holds, then a0 = 0 previously held.
After a0 = 3, it is always the case that if a0 < 3 holds, then a0 = 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 1 .
Between a0 = 3 and a0 <= 3, it is always the case that if a0 > 0 holds, then a0 = 1 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 <= 0 holds, then a0 < 1 previously held and was preceded by a0 <= 1 .
