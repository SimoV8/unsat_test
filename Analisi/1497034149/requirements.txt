Between a0 < 0 and a0 = 0, it is always the case that if a0 >= 1 holds, then a0 < 0 previously held.
After a0 >= 0 until a0 > 1, it is never the case that a0 > 0 holds.
After a0 > 0, it is always the case that if a0 < 0 holds, then a0 > 0 previously held.
Before a0 = 1, it is always the case that if a0 > 1 holds, then a0 < 1 previously held.
Before a0 = 0, it is always the case that if a0 > 1 holds, then a0 <= 1 eventually holds.
Between a0 < 0 and a0 > 1, it is always the case that if a0 < 1 holds and is succeeded by a0 > 1, then a0 > 1 eventually holds after a0 > 1 .
