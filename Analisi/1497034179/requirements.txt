Globally, it is never the case that a0 < 1 holds.
Between a0 < 2 and a0 < 1, it is always the case that if a0 < 2 holds, then a0 = 0 eventually holds.
After a0 >= 2, it is always the case that if a0 <= 1 holds, then a0 > 2 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 < 0 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 2, then a0 >= 2 eventually holds after a0 <= 2 .
Between a0 < 1 and a0 < 1, it is always the case that if a0 >= 1 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 1, then a0 > 2 eventually holds after a0 <= 1 .
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 < 2 holds, then a0 <= 2 previously held and was preceded by a0 > 2 .
After a0 >= 1 until a0 < 2, it is always the case that if a0 = 3 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 1, then a0 >= 2 eventually holds after a0 <= 1 .
Before a0 <= 3, it is always the case that if a0 <= 0 holds, then a0 >= 2 previously held.
