After a0 >= 3, it is always the case that a0 = 1 holds.
Globally, a0 <= 0 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 > 0 holds, then a0 > 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 3, where a0 = 1 does not hold between a0 > 3 and a0 = 3 .
After a0 < 3 until a0 > 1, it is always the case that if a0 > 3 holds, then a0 >= 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 2 .
After a0 > 2, it is always the case that if a0 = 1 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 3, then a0 > 1 previously held.
Between a0 > 3 and a0 = 0, a0 <= 0 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 < 1 holds and is succeeded by a0 = 0, then a0 > 0 eventually holds after a0 = 0 .
After a0 = 1, it is never the case that a0 >= 3 holds.
After a0 > 3 until a0 < 2, it is always the case that if a0 = 1 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 2, then a0 < 3 previously held.
Between a0 < 3 and a0 > 1, it is never the case that a0 <= 1 holds.
After a0 <= 3, it is always the case that if a0 <= 0 holds, then a0 <= 2 previously held and was preceded by a0 <= 1 .
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 <= 1 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 0, then a0 >= 1 previously held.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 <= 2 holds, then a0 = 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 2 .
Before a0 > 3, it is always the case that if a0 <= 0 holds, then a0 = 0 previously held and was preceded by a0 >= 1 .
Before a0 > 2, it is never the case that a0 = 3 holds.
Between a0 >= 2 and a0 <= 2, a0 < 0 eventually holds.
