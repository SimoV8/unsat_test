Before c0 <= 7, b0 < 5 eventually holds.
Before c0 > 0, it is always the case that if a0 = 2 holds, then a0 > 5 eventually holds and is succeeded by b0 >= 5, where a0 >= 1 does not hold between a0 > 5 and b0 >= 5 .
After a0 >= 3 until b0 > 3, it is always the case that a0 > 2 holds.
After c0 <= 0, it is always the case that c0 = 6 holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if c0 > 6 holds, then a0 < 7 eventually holds and is succeeded by b0 <= 4 .
Between a0 <= 4 and c0 < 5, it is always the case that if b0 > 6 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 4, then b0 < 5 eventually holds after a0 >= 4 .
Globally, it is always the case that if c0 <= 3 holds, then b0 > 7 eventually holds.
Between a0 = 7 and c0 = 7, c0 >= 7 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if c0 > 0 holds, then c0 <= 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 5 .
After a0 > 2 until c0 <= 3, it is always the case that if a0 = 3 holds and is succeeded by c0 >= 5, then a0 = 0 eventually holds after c0 >= 5 .
After a0 >= 5, it is always the case that if a0 <= 4 holds, then b0 > 4 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 5, where c0 = 7 does not hold between b0 > 4 and a0 >= 5 .
Globally, c0 = 2 eventually holds.
Between c0 >= 2 and c0 = 7, it is always the case that if c0 < 5 holds, then c0 > 6 eventually holds and is succeeded by b0 >= 5, where b0 < 2 does not hold between c0 > 6 and b0 >= 5 .
After a0 = 3 until b0 <= 7, it is always the case that if a0 < 0 holds, then b0 >= 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 7 .
Before b0 > 7, it is always the case that if c0 <= 5 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 3, then a0 >= 5 eventually holds after a0 <= 3 .
Before b0 >= 5, it is always the case that if c0 <= 0 holds, then a0 >= 4 previously held.
