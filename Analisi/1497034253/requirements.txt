After a0 >= 2 until a0 = 0, it is always the case that if a0 <= 0 holds, then a0 = 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 1 .
After a0 > 1, it is always the case that if a0 = 1 holds, then a0 > 3 previously held and was preceded by a0 <= 2 .
After a0 < 2, it is always the case that if a0 > 1 holds, then a0 >= 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 1 .
After a0 = 1, it is always the case that if a0 < 0 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 0, then a0 = 0 previously held.
Before a0 <= 0, it is always the case that if a0 = 2 holds, then a0 = 1 eventually holds.
Between a0 = 2 and a0 < 1, it is always the case that a0 < 2 holds.
After a0 > 0 until a0 < 3, it is always the case that if a0 = 2 holds, then a0 > 1 previously held.
Globally, it is always the case that a0 < 1 holds.
After a0 >= 3 until a0 = 3, it is always the case that if a0 > 1 holds, then a0 < 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 2, where a0 <= 2 does not hold between a0 < 0 and a0 > 2 .
After a0 > 3 until a0 >= 1, it is always the case that a0 = 0 holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 > 3 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 3, then a0 >= 1 previously held.
After a0 = 0 until a0 <= 0, it is always the case that if a0 = 0 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 3, then a0 <= 3 previously held.
Before a0 < 3, it is always the case that if a0 <= 3 holds, then a0 >= 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 1 .
Before a0 < 1, it is always the case that if a0 <= 0 holds, then a0 < 1 previously held and was preceded by a0 <= 3 .
Between a0 <= 1 and a0 <= 2, it is always the case that if a0 <= 2 holds, then a0 = 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 3, where a0 <= 2 does not hold between a0 = 0 and a0 = 3 .
After a0 = 0 until a0 = 1, it is always the case that if a0 >= 2 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 1, then a0 <= 1 eventually holds after a0 <= 1 .
