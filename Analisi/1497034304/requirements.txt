After a0 >= 1 until a0 = 2, it is always the case that if a0 >= 7 holds, then a0 = 6 eventually holds.
After a0 = 3, a0 = 2 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 >= 0 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 6, then a0 > 2 eventually holds after a0 < 6 .
Before a0 <= 1, it is always the case that if a0 <= 4 holds, then a0 < 5 eventually holds.
Between a0 < 1 and a0 = 7, a0 < 5 eventually holds.
After a0 > 1 until a0 >= 3, it is always the case that if a0 < 1 holds, then a0 > 1 previously held and was preceded by a0 < 5 .
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 >= 2 holds, then a0 >= 2 previously held and was preceded by a0 >= 0 .
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 < 7 holds, then a0 > 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 0, where a0 < 2 does not hold between a0 > 1 and a0 >= 0 .
After a0 >= 0 until a0 < 3, it is always the case that a0 > 4 holds.
After a0 >= 2, a0 >= 5 eventually holds.
After a0 >= 1 until a0 <= 1, it is always the case that if a0 < 3 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 2, then a0 <= 5 eventually holds after a0 >= 2 .
Before a0 = 7, it is always the case that if a0 <= 5 holds, then a0 < 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 = 5, where a0 >= 6 does not hold between a0 < 1 and a0 = 5 .
Globally, it is never the case that a0 >= 3 holds.
After a0 >= 4, it is always the case that if a0 >= 5 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 4, then a0 > 2 previously held.
After a0 <= 7, it is always the case that a0 >= 4 holds.
Before a0 <= 5, it is always the case that if a0 <= 5 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 6, then a0 >= 0 previously held.
