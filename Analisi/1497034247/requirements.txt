Globally, it is always the case that if a0 < 3 holds and is succeeded by a0 > 1, then a0 >= 0 previously held.
Globally, a0 = 1 eventually holds.
After a0 <= 1 until a0 > 3, it is always the case that if a0 < 2 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 3, then a0 > 2 eventually holds after a0 < 3 .
After a0 > 0, it is always the case that if a0 < 1 holds, then a0 = 0 previously held.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 = 2 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 0, then a0 > 1 previously held.

After a0 = 2, it is always the case that if a0 > 3 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 1, then a0 < 2 previously held.
Between a0 <= 3 and a0 > 2, it is always the case that if a0 <= 0 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 2, then a0 > 0 previously held.
After a0 <= 0 until a0 <= 0, it is always the case that if a0 = 0 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 0, then a0 >= 3 previously held.
