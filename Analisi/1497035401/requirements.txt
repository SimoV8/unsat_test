Globally, it is always the case that if c0 >= 6 holds, then a0 <= 5 eventually holds and is succeeded by g0 < 1, where b0 <= 6 does not hold between a0 <= 5 and g0 < 1 .
Globally, it is always the case that d0 >= 5 holds.
After e0 <= 3 until g0 <= 0, it is always the case that if c0 < 6 holds and is succeeded by b0 > 7, then g0 >= 3 eventually holds after b0 > 7 .
Between b0 < 3 and g0 > 6, it is always the case that if a0 <= 0 holds and is succeeded by f0 <= 4, then b0 >= 4 eventually holds after f0 <= 4 .
After c0 <= 3, it is always the case that if f0 <= 5 holds and is succeeded by e0 = 6, then e0 = 7 previously held.
Before d0 < 6, it is always the case that if d0 > 2 holds and is succeeded by c0 >= 1, then f0 = 3 eventually holds after c0 >= 1 .
Before a0 < 3, it is always the case that if b0 <= 0 holds, then a0 = 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by f0 > 1 .
Globally, it is always the case that if d0 > 1 holds and is succeeded by g0 <= 0, then b0 > 6 eventually holds after g0 <= 0 .
Before b0 > 5, it is always the case that g0 < 7 holds.
Between b0 = 6 and f0 > 1, it is never the case that d0 < 5 holds.
