Globally, it is always the case that if a0 < 3 holds, then a0 <= 3 eventually holds.
Between a0 >= 3 and a0 = 0, a0 <= 3 eventually holds.
Between a0 <= 0 and a0 < 1, it is always the case that a0 >= 0 holds.
Between b0 > 3 and c0 > 1, it is always the case that if b0 < 3 holds, then c0 = 2 previously held.
Globally, it is never the case that b0 <= 1 holds.
Between b0 <= 1 and b0 < 1, it is always the case that if c0 > 2 holds, then c0 <= 0 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 1 .
Globally, it is always the case that if c0 = 0 holds and is succeeded by b0 = 1, then b0 >= 0 eventually holds after b0 = 1 .
Globally, it is always the case that if c0 = 1 holds, then c0 = 3 previously held and was preceded by a0 > 3 .
