Between a0 <= 4 and a0 > 6, a0 <= 0 eventually holds.
Between a0 < 4 and a0 < 5, it is always the case that if a0 <= 6 holds, then a0 <= 4 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 3 .
Before a0 < 6, it is always the case that if a0 < 7 holds, then a0 < 3 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 5 .
After a0 < 3, it is always the case that if a0 < 7 holds, then a0 = 6 previously held and was preceded by a0 > 1 .
After a0 > 4, it is always the case that a0 > 2 holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 >= 6 holds, then a0 >= 1 eventually holds and is succeeded by a0 > 4 .
Between a0 >= 1 and a0 <= 7, a0 >= 1 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that a0 = 7 holds.
After a0 < 2, it is never the case that a0 <= 5 holds.
Between a0 > 6 and a0 <= 4, it is always the case that if a0 > 4 holds and is succeeded by a0 <= 3, then a0 = 7 eventually holds after a0 <= 3 .
Between a0 < 1 and a0 < 1, it is always the case that if a0 <= 1 holds and is succeeded by a0 >= 2, then a0 > 4 previously held.
After a0 > 4 until a0 = 2, it is always the case that if a0 = 2 holds and is succeeded by a0 > 7, then a0 >= 5 previously held.
After a0 = 5, a0 = 5 eventually holds.
After a0 >= 2 until a0 = 6, it is always the case that if a0 >= 5 holds, then a0 > 4 eventually holds.
After a0 > 1, it is always the case that if a0 <= 2 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 3, then a0 >= 5 eventually holds after a0 < 3 .
After a0 = 0, it is always the case that if a0 >= 3 holds, then a0 <= 0 eventually holds.
