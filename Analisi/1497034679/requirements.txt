Globally, it is always the case that if c0 <= 2 holds, then c0 > 0 eventually holds.
Before a0 < 1, it is always the case that if b0 >= 0 holds and is succeeded by a0 > 3, then a0 < 0 eventually holds after a0 > 3 .
Before b0 >= 1, it is always the case that if b0 = 3 holds, then a0 > 0 previously held.
After b0 <= 3 until b0 < 1, it is always the case that if c0 >= 1 holds, then a0 <= 2 previously held.
Globally, c0 = 3 eventually holds.
Between b0 >= 1 and a0 = 0, b0 <= 3 eventually holds.
Globally, it is always the case that if a0 >= 3 holds, then c0 >= 2 eventually holds and is succeeded by c0 <= 0, where c0 = 1 does not hold between c0 >= 2 and c0 <= 0 .
Globally, it is always the case that c0 < 2 holds.
After a0 < 2, it is always the case that if a0 = 2 holds, then b0 >= 0 previously held.
Between a0 >= 2 and c0 = 1, a0 > 0 eventually holds.
After a0 < 0, it is always the case that if b0 >= 3 holds, then a0 <= 2 previously held and was preceded by b0 <= 2 .
Globally, it is never the case that c0 < 0 holds.
Before a0 = 2, it is always the case that if b0 <= 3 holds and is succeeded by a0 > 3, then a0 < 1 eventually holds after a0 > 3 .
Globally, it is always the case that if b0 <= 1 holds and is succeeded by a0 < 2, then c0 = 3 previously held.
Before a0 <= 0, it is always the case that b0 >= 1 holds.
After c0 >= 1 until b0 <= 0, it is never the case that a0 = 3 holds.
